# MockAI-Interview-Review-Dashboard


This project involves the design of a front-end mockup for an interactive dashboard dedicated to reviewing audio recordings of interview sessions. The goal is to create a platform that allows users to analyze interview recordings efficiently. The dashboard will leverage a user-friendly interface, enabling users to navigate through the audio recordings with ease.

## Technology Stack & Built With

This project utilizes a robust stack of modern technologies, frameworks, and libraries categorized into frontend development, UI/UX enhancements, and backend utilities to ensure high performance, maintainability, and scalability:

### Frontend Development
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework for building user interfaces with server-side rendering and generating static websites, ideal for projects requiring SEO and optimized performance.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for creating interactive UIs declaratively, making the code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without leaving your HTML.

### UI/UX Libraries
- **[shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui)**: Provides pre-designed components and utilities for building responsive and visually appealing interfaces.
- **[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)**: A set of free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG icons for UI development.
- **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)**: Include icons from popular icon libraries like Font Awesome, Material Design, and others in your React projects.
- **[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8)** (formerly React Table): A lightweight, flexible, and extensible datagrid built for React.

### Backend and Utilities
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for the backend API services to fetch and handle audio data efficiently.
- **[WaveSurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/)**: A customizable waveform audio visualization library built on Web Audio API and Canvas.
