    { start: 44, text: "And as I read that, I'll, um, become quieter and quieter and get to a low whisper so you'll be able to see how the star witness interviewer picks up audio. Um, at those low levels, uh, " },
    { start: 57, text: "one thing to keep in mind is that as you watch the video, um, you might want to listen with headphones such that you get all that sound reproduced and you can hear, um, the low whispers sometimes like a laptop, speakers or something like that might have a difficult time reproducing that sound for you to be able to hear, but headphones will definitely, um, give you a better, uh, listening experience for the video.

    { start: 143, text: "but expectations have definitely been met with the star witness interviewer. " },
    { start: 147, text: "The microphone can pick up the slightest whisper and the picture quality has great resolution. " },

    { start: 152, text: "I've found that even though the system is very high tech, it is also extremely easy to operate.  " },
    { start: 158, text: "I love it because it is not a proprietary system and there aren't any codecs to worry about, and the videos play on either a computer or a DVD player. " },

    { start: 175, text: "The burning tool is ultra easy. Simply put, the system is. To record it and then press the same button to stop. Once your interview is complete, click on the DVD and click. It's that easy. I would highly recommend this product. Any law enforcement agency. Not only for the ease of the system, but the excellent customer service that we've received throughout the years.
